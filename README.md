#### Overview of my path from BME to SWE

*University experience:*
- Junior year of GT: take [CS 1371](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/David.Smith/CS1371_2018_Fall_Syllabus.pdf) (intro **matlab** class)
- Senior year of GT: take [CS 1331](https://csp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/cs_1331_syllabus.pdf) (intro to OOP) and [CS 1332](https://ctl.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/hudachek-buswell_cs1332_syllabus.pdf) (data structures & algorithms), both based in **java**
- Super senior of GT: take [CS 1301](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2016/cs1301_spring/syllabus.html) (intro **python** class)

*Industry experience:
- R&D internship sophomore year of GT: code a really rough web scraper in **python**, use **twilio** library to text out the info
  - Sophomore year - code a really rough web scraper in **python**, use **twilio** library to text out the info

The most impactful items from the above list were definitely the part-time SWE job. This gave me exposure to working with data in python (using the **pandas, twilio, SQLAlchemy**, and **pymysql** libraries), building full stack apps using various tech stacks (first using **JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Apache**; second using **React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Chart.js, MySQL**). Additionally, the OOP knowledge from 1331 and data structures and algorithms knowledge from 1332 were invaluable for technical interviews.
