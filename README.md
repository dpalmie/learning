# Learning Repo
### Repo to aggregate projects that I've done just for fun and learning. Don't judge me if they're wonky!

Overview of my path from BME to SWE
- R&D internship sophomore year of GT: code a really rough web scraper in **python**, use **twilio** library to text out the info
- Junior year of GT: take CS 1371 (intro **matlab** class)
- Senior year of GT: take CS 1331 (intro to OOP) and CS 1332 (data structures & algorithms), both based in **java**
- Super senior of GT: take CS 1301 (intro **python** class), get part-time SWE job at surgical efficiency startup 
- Graduation: secured SWE consulting job at Slalom, staying in Atlanta

The most impactful items from the above list were definitely the part-time SWE job. This gave me exposure to working with data in python (using the **pandas, twilio, SQLAlchemy**, and **pymysql** libraries), building full stack apps using various tech stacks (first using **JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Apache**; second using **React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Chart.js, MySQL**).
